<p>

Let's get an introduction to strings.

Strings are always chain of characters bounded by triple, double quotes or single quotes in Python,
a string can also be just a character.

<pre>
"Hello World"
"12345"
"False"
'my mom is going to school'
Are all strings.</pre>

In order to tell the computer to output a string to the screen,
just write out *print* and between your parenthesis/brackets, type your string.
This applies to all the data types we will look at.

<h5>Accessing Strings</h5>

To obtain substrings, indexing or slicing is used. Square brackets are used and the position (index) of the substring or substrings is
entered within the square brackets; Python then returns the substring or substrings found at this index.

Put this behind your mind, Python treats strings as lists when it comes to
slicing and indexing.

Let's look at a practical example:

From our previous lesson Variable Naming, let's give our fourth string example a name and
then work on it using indexing and slicing.

<pre><code> sentence = 'my mom is going to school'</code></pre>
NB: I gave it the name sentence which is reasonable enough for what the string says.

This string which we have just given the name sentence has a length not equal to the number of
letter in it but every character counts. Space is also a character, so guess what the length or number of characters in it will be.

We can easily do this by using a method called len on the string sentence.
<pre>
<code>print(len(senetence))</code>
This should print out:
>> 25</pre>

Now, say we want to get only the first letter of the sentence, what do we do.

A knowledge of how Python numbers the position of each substring is therefore required.
<div>
<div style="border:solid steelblue 3px;padding:16px;border-radius:20px;background-color:#82daad;">
<blockquote>
                      <span class="fa fa-quote-left"></span>
                      How Python gives indices:
Python gives the first letter in a string the position(index) 0 and the next 0+1 = 1 and the next 0+1+1=2
and it continues so.
Since the first letter is not 1 that means our string's last member will have the index 24, this can also be accessed
using the index -1.
This means when counting from left to right, Python starts from 0 but when counting from right to left Python begins from -1,-2 till it gets to
the first.
Look at the image below:
                    </blockquote></div>
                    <div>

                        <a class="blog_img" href="#">
                          <img src="static/img/string.png" alt="img">
                          <br>
                         <small> Fig.1.0: forward indexing and backward indexing.(credit: javapoint.com)</small>
                        </a>

                    </div>
</div>
<br>

Back to our problem, we want to get the first letter of the string called sentence.

We use square brackets just after the string or the string's name and put the index of the letter we waant
between the square brackets:
<pre>
<code>print(sentence[0])</code></pre>
This should print out the first letter 'm' to the screen for you.

So with that you can get any of the letters from the string, but what if you put in 25?

Our string *ranges* from 0-24 so putting in 25 will
mean you are asking for a letter that is
not in the string and therefore out of the range.
This will raise an error which we shall learn to handle.

Another problem:
What if we wanted to get 'mom' or any other word from the string.

Here comes slicing, we specify the beginning index (that is, where we want Python to put the knife first), separated by a colon(:) and
the last index (not inclusive), that is the border. All this should hapen in the square brackets.

So to get 'mom' printed out from 'my mom is going to school':
The first 'm' standds at index 3 and the last 'm' stands at index 5, but we want it to be included so we give the next
index as the border (which is 6).

<pre><code>print(sentence[3:6])</code>

This should print out
<code>>> mom</code></pre>

<h5>STRING OPERATIONS</h5>

If you want Python to begin slicing the list from the beginning, you do not need to begin with 0,
you can begin like this:
<pre><code>print(sentence[ :6]))</code>

This should print out:
>> my mom
</pre>
The same way if you want Python to begin from somewhere say after 'mom' to the very last
letter, then you can do this:
<pre><code>print(senetence[6: ])</code>

This should give you:
>> is going to school
</pre>
Skipping some substrings

You can also specify steps at which Python should slice a list using a third index called the step.

So generally, to slice a string:
<pre>
<code>ListName[begin:end:step]</code>

<code>print(sentence[ : : 2])</code>
</pre>
 This means Python should print the first letter, jump to the next 2 and print that and jump
 to the next 2 and should continue to do so until it gets to the end.

 This will be very useful when working with lists like a list off ccounting numbers
 and you want to get only even numbers or odd numbers.

<h5>STRING METHODS</h5>

Strings can further be manipulated using mathematical operations and built-in method.

You can attach two strings together by using the + operator:
<pre>
<code>'my mom is '+'going to school'</code>
will produce (Please note the space at the end of 'is'):
>> my mom is going to school

You can also repeat a string using the * operator:
<code>'my mom ' * 3</code>
Should produce:
>> my mom my mom my mom

To find out if a character or characters ooccur in a string, you could use *in* or *not in* keywords:

This will be better understood under conditioning your code section. But for now:

<code>
if 'm' in sentence:
    print("m exists")
else:
    print("nope, no m")
    </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>Python also provides built-in methods that can be used
    to manipulate strings in other ways.

These methods are called on the string in question and if arguments are
required for the method to properly execute,
you provide those arguments.
You must call the string and then bring a dot(.) and the name of the method after
which comes paranthesis or round brackets in
which arguments are provided if any. The paranthesis are still
brought even if there were no arguments to provide.
<pre>
1. .capitalize()
This will capilize the first letter of the string.

2. .center(width,filchar)
Returns a space-padded string with the original
string centered to a total of width given.

3. .count(substring,begin=0,end=len(string))
This counts how many times a substring occurs within the original string.
You can specify where Python should start looking from
using the begin argument and the end, where Python should stop looking.
These two howver default to begin being the start and end being the end
of the string.

</pre>

<h5>String Formatting</h5>

One of Python's coolest features is the string format operator %.
This operator is unique to strings and makes up for the pack of having functions
from C's printf() family. Following is a simple example:



<pre><code>print ("My name is %s and weight is %d kg!") % ('Ellie', 60)</code>

When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:

>>My name is Ellie and weight is 60 kg!
</pre>
Here is the list of complete set of symbols which can be used along with %:

<pre>
Symbol	Functionality

*	argument specifies width or precision

-	left justification

+	display the sign

<sp>	leave a blank space before a positive number

#	add the octal leading zero ( '0' ) or hexadecimal
leading '0x' or '0X', depending on whether 'x' or 'X' were used.
0	pad from left with zeros (instead of spaces)

%	'%%' leaves you with a single literal '%'

(var)	mapping variable (dictionary arguments)

m.n.	m is the minimum total width and n is the number
of digits to display after the decimal point (if appl.)
</pre>
<h5>TRIPPLE QUOTES</h5>

Python's triple quotes comes to the rescue by allowing strings to span multiple lines,
including verbatim NEWLINEs, TABs, and any other special characters.

The syntax for triple quotes consists of three consecutive single or double quotes.
<pre>
<code>
para_str = """this is a long string that is made up of
several lines and non-printable characters such as
TAB ( \t ) and they will show up that way when displayed.
NEWLINEs within the string, whether explicitly given like
this within the brackets [ \n ], or just a NEWLINE within
the variable assignment will also show up.
"""
print (para_str)</code>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result.
Note how every single special character has been converted to its printed form,
right down to the last NEWLINE at the end of the string between the "up."
and closing triple quotes.

Also note that NEWLINEs occur either with an explicit carriage return
at the end of a line or its escape code (\n):
<code>
this is a long string that is made up of
several lines and non-printable characters such as
TAB (    ) and they will show up that way when displayed.
NEWLINEs within the string, whether explicitly given like
this within the brackets [
 ], or just a NEWLINE within
the variable assignment will also show up.
Raw strings don't treat the backslash as a special character at all.
Every character you put into a raw string stays the way you wrote it:
</code>


<code>print ('C:\\nowhere')</code>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:

<code>>>C:\nowhere</code>

Now let's make use of raw string.
We would put expression in r'expression' as follows:



<code>print (r'C:\\nowhere')</code>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:

<code>>>C:\\nowhere</code>
</pre>

<h5>UNICODE STRINGS</h5>
Normal strings in Python are stored internally as 8-bit ASCII,
while Unicode strings are stored as 16-bit Unicode. This allows for a more varied set of characters,
including special characters from most languages in the world. I'll restrict my treatment of Unicode strings to the following:

<pre>
<code>print (u'Hello, world!')</code>
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:

<code>>>Hello, world!</code>
</pre>
As you can see, Unicode strings use the prefix u, just as raw strings use the prefix r.
