                        <h4>What is an operator?</h4>
Simple answer can be given using expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator.
Python language supports the following types of operators.
<ul>
    <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
    <li>Comparison (i.e., Relational) Operators</li>
    <li>Assignment Operators</li>
    <li>Logical Operators</li>
    <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
    <li>Membership Operators</li>
    <li>Identity Operators</li>
    </ul>
Let's have a look on all operators one by one.
<h4>Python Arithmetic Operators</h4>
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:

<pre>
    a = 10
    b = 20
</pre>
<pre>
        Operator           Description                                    Example
    +   Addition           - Adds values on either side
                                        of the operator                       a + b will give 30

    -  Subtraction        - Subtracts right hand operand
                                   from left hand operand                 a - b will give -10

    *  Multiplication     - Multiplies values on either
                                    side of the operator                  a * b will give 200

    /  Division           - Divides left hand operand
                                    by right hand operand                 b / a will give 2

    %  Modulus            - Divides left hand operand by right
                                hand operand and returns remainder        b % a will give 0

    ** Exponent           - Performs exponential (power) calculation
                            on operators                                  a**b will give 10 to the power 20

    //  Floor Division     - The division of operands where the result
                                is the quotient in which the digits
                                after the decimal point are removed.      9//2 is equal to 4 and
                                                                            9.0//2.0 is equal to 4.0

<h4>Python Comparison Operators</h4>
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:
<pre>

    b = 20
</pre>
<pre>
    Operator                   Description                                                Example

    == (it is equal to)            Checks if the value of two
                                operands are equal or not,
                                if yes then condition becomes true.                     (a == b) is false.

    != (it is not equal to)    Checks if the value of two operands are equal
                                or not, if values are not equal then
                                condition becomes true.                                    (a != b) is true.

    <>                         Checks if the value of two operands
                                are equal or not, if values are not
                                equal then condition becomes true.                     (a <> b) is true.
                                This is similar to != operator.

    > (greater than)           Checks if the value of left operand
                                is greater than the value of right
                                operand, if yes then condition becomes true.           (a > b) false.


    < (less than)              Checks if the value of left operand is
                                less than the value of right operand,
                                if yes then condition becomes true.                        (a < b) is true.

    >= (greter than
        or equal to)           Checks if the value of left operand is
                                greater than or equal to the value of right
                                operand, if yes then condition becomes true.           (a >= b) is false.

    <= (less than
    or equal to)                Checks if the value of left operand is less
                                than or equal to the value of right operand,
                                if yes then condition becomes true.                        (a <= b) is true.

    <h4>Python Bitwise Operators</h4>
Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation.
Assume if a = 60; and b = 13; Now in binary format they will be as follows:
<pre>
a = 0011 1100
b = 0000 1101
-----------------
a&b = 0000 1100
a|b = 0011 1101
a^b = 0011 0001
~a  = 1100 0011
    </pre>
<br>
There are following Bitwise operators supported by Python language
<pre>

    Operator           Description                                 Example

    &                  Binary AND Operator copies a
                        bit to the result if it exists
                        in both operands.                      (a & b) will give 12 which is 0000 1100

    |                  Binary OR Operator copies
                        a bit if it exists in eather operand.  (a | b) will give 61 which is 0011 1101

    ^                  Binary XOR Operator copies the
                        bit if it is set in one operand
                        but not both.                          (a ^ b) will give 49 which is 0011 0001

    ~                  Binary Ones Complement Operator
                        is unary and has the efect of
                        'flipping' bits.                       (~a ) will give -61 which is 1100 0011 in
                                                                2's complement form due to a signed binary number.

    <<                 Binary Left Shift Operator.
                        The left operands value is moved
                        left by the number of bits specified
                        by the right operand.                  a << 2 will give 240 which is 1111 0000

    >>                 Binary Right Shift Operator.
                        The left operands value is moved
                        right by the number of bits specified
                        by the right operand.                  a >> 2 will give 15 which is 0000 1111

<h4>Python Logical Operators</h4>
There are following logical operators supported by Python language.
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then:
<pre>
    a = 10
    b = 20
</pre>
<br>
<pre>

    Operator   Description                            Example

    and            Called Logical AND operator.
                If both the operands are
                true then then condition
                becomes true.                      (a and b) is true.
                                                    Meaning, a and b are non zero.


    or         Called Logical OR Operator.
                If any of the two operands
                are non zero then condition
                becomes true.                       (a or b) is true.

    not            Called Logical NOT Operator.
                Used to reverses the logical
                state of its operand.
                If a condition is true then
                Logical
                NOT operator will make false.      not(a and b) is false.
</pre>
<h4>Python Membership Operators</h4>
In addition to the operators discussed previously, Python has membership operators,
which test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples. There are two membership operators explained below:
<pre>
    y = [1,'x',2,'hello','Effie',5.6]

</pre>
<br>
<pre>

    Operator   Description                                Example

    in         Evaluates to true if it finds a
                variable in the specified sequence
                and false otherwise.                   'x' in y, here in results in a 1(true)
                                                        if x is a member of sequence y.

    not in     Evaluates to true if it does not
                finds a variable in the specified
                sequence and false otherwise.          'b' not in y, here not in results in
                                                         a 1(true) if x is not a member of sequence y.
</pre>
<br>
<h4>Python Identity Operators</h4>
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects. There are two Identity operators explained below:
<pre>

    Operator   Description                                        Example

    is         Evaluates to true if the variables
                on either side of the operator
                point to the same object and false otherwise.  x is y, here is results in 1 if id(x) equals id(y).

    is not     Evaluates to false if the variables
                on either side of the operator point
                to the same object and true otherwise.         x is not y, here is not results in 1
                                                                if id(x) is not equal to id(y).
    </pre>
