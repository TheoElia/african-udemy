                        Most of our daily activities are based on conditions. "I will go to the grocery when or if the rain
stops", "This team can only win the world cup if it beats the other team in the finals."
Sometimes, the conditions maybe more than one; "this team will win the world cup if it wins
in the semi finals AND in the finals."
Other times the condition maybe either this or that; "Nigeria will be through to the next stage
if they win OR draw their next match."
In each case, something happens when then condition given occurs (becomes true); "this team will win the world cup"
and another thing hapens when the condition given does not occur (becomes false);"this team will not win the world cup".

<h4>if,elif and else</h4>
Computer programming allows for specifying conditions that will be checked before executing a particular code.
Python uses <code> if, elif ,else </code> to check for conditions before executing a particular code.
You can therefore place your code under a certain condition which is to be checked by the interpreter
before executing the code.
<h4>The Syntax</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bring the beginning condition clause (if, elif, else) and then place the condition to be
    evaluated just a space after the if or elif (else does not take a condition)</li>
    <li>Use comparison operators (<, >, ==,..) when neccessary</li>
    <li>If there are more than one conditions to be evaluated, then bring the appropriate logical operator (and/or)</li>
    <li>Bring a colon(:) and then move to the next line and tab (or move four spaces to the right)</li>
    <li>Specify what should happen is if the condition becomes true</li>
    <li>use else or elif to specify what should happen if the previous condition is false</li>
</ol>

The following example should set the pace:
This programs checks the current value of temperature named temp and tells the user what
the weather outside should be. Feel free to copy and paste the code in your editor.
Play around it.(The hash (#) is used to comment in Python code:
The interpreter therefore ignores words that come after a #.

<pre>
    #Takes temperature value as input from user
    temp = input("Enter the current temperature value:")
    #Converts and updates temp value from string to an integer
    temp = int(temp)
    #checks if temp is greater than 30
    if temp > 30:
        print("Its hot outside")
    #checks if temp is equal to 30
    elif temp == 30:
        print("It should be a normal weather")
    #checks if temp is less than 30 AND greater than 15
    #Both must be true for the code (print("The weather is cold"))
    #To execute
    elif temp < 30 and temp > 15:
        print ("The weather is cold")
    else:
        print("it's freezing out there")
</pre>
<h4>Nested Conditions</h4>
These are conditions that depend on other conditions to evaluate their own statements.
Consider this:
Go to my house (number 13) and check if my Dad or Mom is home and then
give the money to my Dad. but if my Dad is not home, you could give it to my mom.
if none of the two is home, bring back my money to me.
And return my money if you do not find my house.

You realize that you would have by passed a lot of houses on your way to my house
because they do not bear the number 13.
This condition has to be first fulfilled before you look for my dad or mom and give out
the money.
So giving out the money to my dad or mom depends on whether you found my house or not.

Let us write a simple Python program to illustrate this idea:
<pre>
    #Takes house number as input and converts to integer on the same line
    house = int(input("Enter house number"))

    #First condition to check if house number is 13
    if house == 13:
        #After house number is 13, checks if dad or mom is home
        #Takes Yes or No as input representing the presence of dad or mom
        dad_or_mom = input("Is Dad or Mom Home: Yes/No:")
        if dad_or_mom == 'Yes':
            print("Give this money to him or her")
        #If mom or dad is not home
        else:
            print("I found the house but neither dad nor mom was home")
    #If house number is not 13
    else:
        print("I could not find the house")
</pre>
<br>
After running and trying out a few inputs, you will notice that the option that asks if dad or mom
is home is never shown except if the house number is 13.
This means that you do not ask the question "Is mom or dad home?" if you have not found the house
you were sent to (number 13).<br>

    <center><h5 style="color:steelblue;">TIP</h5></center>
    Remember to always make your program as practical as possible, this helps you understand
    how the computer "thinks" while running your code and if you understand how the computer "thinks"
    then you can manipulate it as much as possible.
