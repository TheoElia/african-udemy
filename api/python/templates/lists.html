 <p>
                        Python's list is another datatype that can be used to keep other basic datatypes
in a fairly organised manner. This is because members of a list
are given position numbers by the Python interpreter and therefore
can be accessed using their positions called indexes. A list is therefore a squence.

To define a python list:
listname = [first_member,second_member,...]

These members can be any of the following datatypes:
<pre>
Boolean
Number
String
List
Tuple
Dictionary
</pre>
<br>

<h4>List Indexing</h4>
Python assigns integers to the position of the members in the list.
The first_member gets the index 0, the second_member gets the
index 1 and so on Python adds 1 to the previous index to get the index
of the current member.Since a list can contain a lot of members at once, the last
member is referenced -1 to make it easier to access.
<br>
<h4>Indexing Vs. Slicing Lists</h4>
When you create a list in python, python gives a position number to each item in the list depending on
where it appears in the list, the numbering is done
from 0 to the last item (n-1), where n is the number if items in the list.
So, if there are 10 items in a list, the first item will take position(index) 0 and the last item will take (10-1) = 9.

You can therefore request Python to give you a particular item from the list by specifying it's index to Python - indexing

You can also ask Python to give you items from a certain point to a certain point,
you can even specify if Python should jump over particular ones, this is called list slicing.


<h4>The Program</h4>
<pre>
My_list = ['hello', 2,3.6,True]

#Let's call print
print(My_list)

#Now let's specify some index
print(My_list[3])

#This should print the
#fourth item in the
#list which is at index 3.

#Now let's slice

print(My_list[0:3])

#This should print from the first
#item to the third item,
#leaving out the one at
#index 3
</pre>


<br>

When you want Python to print from the beginning of the list, you don't need to specify the 0, just do this list_name [ : end index here].

If you want Python to print out every member of the list but at a certain step, then do this:
list_name[ : :step]

If your step was 2, then Python will print the first item and jump to the third and jump to the fifth,
that's a smart way print out odd number is your list is made of counting numbers.

You can simply ask for a reverse list by making your step -1,
this will tell Pytjon to print the last item first and go backwards.

Like this:

<pre>list_name[ : : -1]</pre>


Python should print out a reverse list.

<div style="border:solid steelblue 3px;padding:16px;border-radius:20px;background-color:#82daad;">
<h5 style="color:steelblue;">Try it Out <i class="fa fa-free-code-camp"></i></h5>
Create a list of counting numbers from 0 to 21, extract a reverse of even numbers from it.
Python should print out a reverse list.
</div>



<h4>Updating Lists</h4>
You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on
the left-hand side of the assignment operator, and you can add to elements
in a list with the append() method. Following is a simple example:

<pre>
list = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];

print ("Value available at index 2 : ",list[2])

list[2] = 2001
print ("New value available at index 2 : ",list[2])
</pre>

When the above code is executed, it produces the following result:
<pre>
Value available at index 2 : 1997
New value available at index 2 : 2001
</pre>

<h4>Delete List Elements</h4>
To remove a list element, you can use either the del statement if you know exactly which element(s)
you are deleting or the remove() method if you do not know. Following is a simple example:


<pre>list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];

>>print (list1)
>>del list1[2]
print ("After deleting value at index 2 : ",list1;)
</pre>
When the above code is executed, it produces following result:
<pre>
['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]
After deleting value at index 2 :
['physics', 'chemistry', 2000]
</pre>
<br>

<h4>Basic List Operations</h4>
Lists respond to the + and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation
and repetition here too, except that the result is a new list, not a string.

In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the Strings section.

Python Expression	               Results	                Description
len([1, 2, 3])	                       3                	Length
[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]	        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]	        Concatenation
['Hi!'] * 4	                ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']	Repetition
3 in [1, 2, 3]	                       True	                Membership
for x in [1, 2, 3]: print x,	       1 2 3	            Iteration

<h4>Indexing, Slicing, and Matrixes</h4>
Because lists are sequences, indexing and slicing work the same way for lists as they do for strings.

Assuming following input:
<br>
<pre>
L = ['spam', 'Spam', 'SPAM!']


Python Expression       	Results         	Description

L[2]                        'SPAM!'         	    Offsets start at zero

L[-2]	                    'Spam'	            Negative: count from the right

L[1:]	                ['Spam', 'SPAM!']	    Slicing fetches sections

</pre>

<h4>Built-in List Functions & Methods</h4>

Python includes the following list functions:
