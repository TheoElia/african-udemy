                        <h4>What are Boolean Values?</h4>
Python uses <code>bool</code> value to express true or false values. Booleans  values are only two, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>
Boolean value is named after a British Mathematician called George Boole,  George Boole created Boolean Algebra, which is the basis of all modern computer arithmetic.
In Python, boolean values are <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, take notice of the capitalization because <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>
are not boolean values and therefore will throw an error.
The boolean values <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are not quoted like strings, which means Python recognises them written
raw like that.
<h4>Boolean Expressions</h4>
These are Python expressions or "calculations" that return a boolean value (True or False).
Expressions that use comparison operators return boolean value as a result.
For example, If this were put to you: 3 is greater than 2, your response will not be a number like 5 because we are comparing.
You will probably say: "That's not true (False)".
But an expression like: 3 + 2 should nt yield a true or false answer but another number.

So basically, when you write a boolean expression, you should expect True or False and based on the boolean value returned,
you can continue your program or stop or branch.

    if statements are boolean expressions also, because they check if a condition is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. If statements however,
    might not return a True or False value but will execute the code under the "if condition" if the condition evaluates to true and will
    execute the code under the "else condition" if the condition is false.
    Loops also rely on boolean values to execute. In fact, conditional expressions depend on boolean values to execute.

<h4>Examples</h4>
Copy and run the following code, it might help in understanding the boolean concept
<pre>
    print(type(True))
    print(type("False"))
    print(3 > 2)
    print(5==5)
    print(6>=6)
    if 5 > 6:
    #what gets printed should the above expression be True
        print("Yes, 5 is greater")
    #What gets printed when the above expression is False
    else:
        print("Nope, 5 is not greater")
</pre>
